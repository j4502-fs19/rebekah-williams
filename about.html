<div class="column"><h2> I'm a senior at the University of Missouri studying convergence journalism and political science. This spring, I will be working as the assistant editor for the community outreach desk at the <a href "https://columbiamissourian.com">Columbia Missourian</a> our local paper here in Columbia that partners with the university.</h2>

<h2>During fall 2019, I worked on the community outreach team as a content creator, which included drafing social media posts, compiling monthly analytics reports and contributing to the 3rd Annual Columbia Missourian <a href "https://columbiamissourian.com/progress">Progress Awards</a> as a videographer and reporter. I also was a supervising editor for the Missouri School of Journalism's Convergence Journalism program, where I guided, assisted and evaluated 30 reporters through the reporting, producing and publication process.</h2>

 <h2> I spent summer 2019 in Washington D.C. as a social media and digital marketing intern with, <a href "http://smithsonianassociates.org">Smithsonian Associates</a> the nonprofit education branch of the Smithsonian Institution. It was here that I discovered my passion for audience engagement and figuring out how I could bring my skills as a journalist to the digital content side of an organization.</h2>

 <h2>I grew up in a small town south of St. Louis, so Imo's Pizza, Cardinals baseball and the Gateway Arch are in my blood. On a good day, I drink a large coffee and on a bad one, I drink multiple. I will always accept tickets to see live theatre, hear a guest lecture or take a class on something new. I am a strong believer that respectful debates build character and love to buy 1000+ piece puzzles only to complete them in one sitting.</h2>
