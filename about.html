<div class="recent_history">
  <p>I'm a senior at the University of Missouri-Columbia studying convergence journalism and political science. This spring, I will be working as the Assistant Editor for the Community Outreach desk at the Columbia Missourian, our local paper here in Columbia that partners with the University of Missouri. </p>

  <p>During fall 2019, I worked on the Community Outreach team as a content creator, which included drafing social media posts, compiling monthly analytics reports and contributing to the 3rd Annual Columbia Missourian Progress Awards as a videographer and reporter. I also was a supervising editor for the Missouri School of Journalism's Convergence Journalism program, where I guided, assisted and evaluated 30 reporters.</p>

  <p>I spent summer 2019 in Washington D.C. as a social media and digital marketing intern with Smithsonian Associates, the nonprofit education branch of the Smithsonian Institution. It was here that I discovered my passion for audience engagement and figuring out how I could bring my skills as a journalist to the digital content side of an organization.</p>

  <p> I grew up in a small town south of St. Louis, so Imo's Pizza, Cardinals baseball and the Gateway Arch are in my blood. On a good day, I drink a large coffee and on a bad one, I drink multiple. I will always accept tickets to see live theatre, hear a guest lecture or take a class on something new. I am a strong believer that respectful debates build character and love to buy 1000+ piece puzzles only to complete them in one sitting.</p>
